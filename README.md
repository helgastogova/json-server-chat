## Running the Project

To run the project, follow these steps:

Install the project dependencies using npm:

```bash
npm install
```

Once the dependencies are installed, you have two options for running the project:

**If you have concurrently installed globally**, you can use the following command to start both the development server and the JSON server concurrently:

```bash
npm run dev-all
```

To install concurrently globally on your system, you can use the following command:

```bash
npm install -g concurrently
```

**If you don't have concurrently installed**, you can run the development server and JSON server in separate terminal windows. Open one terminal and run:

```bash
npm run dev
```

This will start the development server.

Open another terminal and run:

```bash
npm run server
```
